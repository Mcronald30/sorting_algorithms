0x1B. C - Sorting algorithms & Big O

Sorting algorithms are algorithms designed to arrange elements in a specific order,
typically in ascending or descending order, based on a secified key .
Sorting is a basic operation in programming and is frequently used in various applications
and data manipulation tasks.

Big O notation describe the performance characteristics of algorithms. Big O notation
describes how the runtime of an algorithm scales with respect to the input size.
